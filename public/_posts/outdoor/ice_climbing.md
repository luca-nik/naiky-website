Last year me and Francesco got the ice-sickness.

And we went many times up in the Dolomites to admire such ephemeral construction of mother nature that are the ice waterfalls.

And of course climb them:

We went up ``Ursprung``

``Swords of Damocles`` and ``Lujanta``:

Ice climbing is tough: you end up climbing dangerous ephemeral formations in the freezing cold of north walls in winter, where falling would result almost always in a serious injury.

And yet is one of my favourite activities. The charm of such water formations and the feeling of reward you get from climbing them is just incredible.
