# Research Lead Assignment Solutions: Metronome 1.0 Arbitrage

Today I provide insights into one of the solutions I developed for a job interview as Blockchain Research Lead. This solution focuses on analyzing arbitrage opportunities within the [Metronome (MET)](https://metronome.io/) cryptocurrency ecosystem and in particular in the old [Autonomous Converter Contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x686e5ac50d9236a9b7406791256e47feddb26aba).

## What You'll Find Here

In this section, I detail my exploration of Metronome's unique economic design and the algorithmic strategy I proposed to exploit arbitrage opportunities effectively. Specifically, I delve into:

- The **Metronome 1.0 ecosystem** and its core components.
- The **arbitrage opportunities** created by its dual-price mechanism.
- The **mathematical framework** used to analyze and optimize arbitrage conditions.
- A proposed **high-frequency trading strategy** for maximizing profits while maintaining ecosystem stability.

### Why This Matters

Metronome is a fascinating case study in decentralized finance (DeFi) innovation. Its autonomous design fosters liquidity and self-regulation, making it a prime candidate for algorithmic trading applications. Understanding and leveraging arbitrage opportunities in such systems highlights both the theoretical and practical aspects of market efficiency in DeFi.

### Key Highlights of My Solution

- **System Overview:** Analyzed the functionality of Metronomeâ€™s smart contracts, including the Daily Price Auction (DPA) and the Autonomous Converter Contract (ACC).
- **Arbitrage Mechanics:** Developed a mathematical model to identify arbitrage opportunities between the DPA and ACC price mechanisms.
- **Trading Strategy:** Designed a high-frequency trading strategy based on profit maximization, incorporating simulations to validate its effectiveness.

You can find a complete breakdown of this solution, including equations, strategies, and Python simulation results, in the following document:
