In the past few months, I've been going through a lot.  
While organizing my house—a much-needed step to sort out some of the inner chaos—I found a piece of paper where I had written down a thought some time ago.  

<div class="quote-box">
    <blockquote>
        Perso<br>
        Dai sentieri che ho tracciato<br>
        prima ancora di averli percorsi.<br>
        Ed io,<br>
        smarrito,<br>
        mi trovo.
    </blockquote>
</div>

Which translates to something like:
<div class="quote-box">
    <blockquote>
        Lost,<br>
        From the paths I have traced<br>
        even before walking them.<br>
        And I,<br>
        lost,<br>
        find myself.
    </blockquote>
</div>

It has been tough to overcome the preconceived ideas I had about myself and the life I thought I wanted.
But once I did, I finally felt that what I was doing, I was really doing it for myself.

This is Marco, a very good friend of me, looking down to the route we just rock-climbed.
It develops on a big-wall where the rock is not properly solid and orientation is not a joke.

We got lost.

It's part of the game, no?

See you soon ...
